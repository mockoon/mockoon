  <h1>@Mockoon/cli</h1>
</div>

Welcome to Mockoon's official CLI, a lightweight and fast NPM package to deploy your mock APIs anywhere.
Feed it with a Mockoon's [data file](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-storage-location/), or OpenAPI specification file (JSON or YAML), and you are good to go.

The CLI supports the same features as the main application: [templating system](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/overview/), [proxy mode](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/proxy-mode/), [route response rules](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/), etc.

## Installation

```sh-session
$ npm install -g @mockoon/cli
```

Usage:

```sh-session
$ mockoon-cli COMMAND
```

## Changelogs

You will find Mockoon applications [changelogs](https://mockoon.com/releases/) on the official website.

## Run a mock API with the CLI

### Use your Mockoon environment file

The CLI can import and migrate data from older versions of Mockoon. However, it doesn't alter the file you provide and only migrates a copy. If you created your mock with a more recent version of the application, you need to update your CLI with the following command: `npm install -g @mockoon/cli`.

You can run your mock in one single step using the [start command](#mockoon-cli-start) and replacing `~/path/to/your-environment-file.json` by the actual location of your Mockoon environment file:

```sh-sessions
$ mockoon-cli start --data ~/path/to/your-environment-file.json
```

> To locate your environment file from the main application, right-click on a environment and select "Show in folder" in the context menu:
> ![context menu - show in folder](https://mockoon.com/images/docs/repo/cli/environment-show-in-folder.png)

You can also directly load Mockoon's environment file from a URL. To do so, provide the URL as the `data` parameter instead of a local path:

```sh-sessions
$ mockoon-cli start --data https://domain.com/your-environment-file.json
```

### Use an OpenAPI specification file

Another option is to directly pass an OpenAPI specification file as the `data` parameter. Mockoon supports both JSON and YAML formats in versions 2.0.0 and 3.0.0.

> ⚠️ There is currently no equivalent between all the OpenAPI specifications and Mockoon's features ([more info](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/openapi/openapi-specification-compatibility/)). If you want to run your Mockoon mock APIs with the CLI with all the features (templating, rules, etc.), you must use Mockoon's data files ([see above](#use-your-mockoon-environment-file)) directly, or you may lose part of your mock's behavior.

You can provide a path to a local OpenAPI specification file or directly the file's URL:

```sh-sessions
$ mockoon-cli start --data ~/path/to/your-opeanapi-file.yaml
```

Or,

```sh-sessions
$ mockoon-cli start --data https://domain.com/your-opeanapi-file.yaml
```

## Compatibility

Mockoon's CLI has been tested on Node.js versions 18 and 20.

## Commands

- [Start command](#start-command)
- [Dockerize command](#dockerize-command)
- [Help command](#help-command)

### Start command

Starts one (or more) mock API from Mockoon's environment file(s) as a foreground process.

The mocks will run by default on the ports and hostnames specified in the files. You can override these values by using the `--port` and `--hostname` flags.
`--data`, `--port` and `--hostname` flags support multiple entries to run multiple mock APIs at once (see examples below).

> 💡 To run the CLI as a background process, add an `&` at the end of the command: `mockoon-cli start -d ./data-file.json &`.

```
USAGE
  $ mockoon-cli start

OPTIONS
  -d, --data                 [required] Path(s) or URL(s) to your Mockoon file(s)
  -p, --port                 Override environment(s) port(s)
  -l, --hostname             Override default listening hostname(s)
  -t, --log-transaction      Log the full HTTP transaction (request and response)
  -X, --disable-log-to-file  Disable logging to file
  -r, --repair               If the data file seems too old, or an invalid Mockoon file, migrate/repair without prompting
  -h, --help                 Show CLI help

EXAMPLES
  $ mockoon-cli start --data ~/data.json
  $ mockoon-cli start --data ~/data1.json ~/data2.json --port 3000 3001 --hostname 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.1
  $ mockoon-cli start --data https://file-server/data.json
  $ mockoon-cli start --data ~/data.json --log-transaction
```

### Dockerize command

Generates a Dockerfile used to build a self-contained image of one or more mock API. After building the image, no additional parameters will be needed when running the container.
This command takes similar flags as the [`start` command](#mockoon-start).
The `--disable-log-to-file` flag will be enabled by default in the resulting Dockerfile.

Please note that this command will copy your Mockoon environments files you provide with the `--data` flag and put them side by side with the generated Dockerfile.

For more information on how to build the image: [Using the dockerize command](#using-the-dockerize-command)

```
USAGE
  $ mockoon-cli dockerize

OPTIONS
  -d, --data                  [required] Path or URL to your Mockoon file
  -p, --port                  [required] Ports to expose in the Docker container. It should match the number of environment data files you provide with the --data flag.
  -o, --output                [required] Generated Dockerfile path and name (e.g. `./folder/Dockerfile`)
  -t, --log-transaction       Log the full HTTP transaction (request and response)
  -h, --help                  Show CLI help

EXAMPLES
  $ mockoon-cli dockerize --data ~/data.json --output ./Dockerfile
  $ mockoon-cli dockerize --data ~/data1.json ~/data2.json --output ./Dockerfile
  $ mockoon-cli dockerize --data https://file-server/data.json --output ./Dockerfile
```

### Help command

Returns information about a command.

```
USAGE
  $ mockoon-cli help [COMMAND]

ARGUMENTS
  COMMAND  command to show help for

OPTIONS
  --all  see all commands in CLI
```

## Use the GitHub Action

We maintain a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mockoon-cli) that allows you to run your Mockoon CLI in your CI/CD pipelines.

You can find a [sample workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mockoon-cli#github-action-usage) in the GitHub Action's documentation.

Here is an example of a workflow that will run your mock API on every push to the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: Mockoon CLI demo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  mockoon-cli-demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Mockoon CLI
        uses: mockoon/cli-action@v1
        with:
          # Mockoon CLI version, default to 'latest'
          version: 'latest'
          # Mockoon local data file or URL
          data-file: './mockoon-data.json'
          # port, default to 3000
          port: 3000
      - name: Make test call
        run: curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/endpoint`
```

> 💡 If you are building your own actions with the CLI, do not forget to add an `&` at the end of the command to run it in the background and avoid blocking the workflow: `mockoon-cli start -d ./data-file.json &`.

## Docker image

### Using the generic Docker image

A generic Docker image is published on the [Docker Hub Mockoon CLI repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mockoon/cli). It uses `node:18-alpine` and installs the latest version of Mockoon CLI.

All of `mockoon-cli start` flags (`--port`, etc.) must be provided when running the container.

To load the Mockoon data, you can either mount a local data file and pass `mockoon-cli start` flags at the end of the command:

`docker run -d --mount type=bind,source=/home/your-data-file.json,target=/data,readonly -p 3000:3000 mockoon/cli:latest --data data --port 3000`

Or directly pass a URL to the `mockoon-cli start` command, without mounting a local data file:

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 mockoon/cli:latest -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mockoon/mock-samples/main/samples/generate-mock-data.json --port 3000`

Mockoon CLI's logs will be sent to stdout/stderr (console). File logging is disabled by default in the Docker image.

#### Docker compose

You can also use `docker-compose` with a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
mock-server:
  image: mockoon/cli:latest
  command: ["--data", "data", "--port", "3000"]
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:3000/your-healthcheck-route || exit 1"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 2
    start_period: 10s
  volumes:
    - /home/your-data-file.json:/data:readonly
```

> Please note that our [Docker image includes an `ENTRYPOINT`](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/cli/docker/Dockerfile#L16) that you may override or not. If you don't override it, and use Docker compose `command`, do not include `mockoon-cli start` as it is already included in the `ENTRYPOINT`.

This snippet also provides an optional healthcheck, which means you can block until the server is able to handle responses when bring it up by running `docker compose up --detach --wait`.

> This example requires a `your-healthcheck-route` route configured to return a 200 status code without latency.

### Using the `dockerize` command

You can use the [`dockerize` command](#mockoon-cli-dockerize) to generate a new Dockerfile that will allow you to build a self-contained image. Thus, no Mockoon CLI specific parameters will be needed when running the container.

- Run the `dockerize` command:

  `mockoon-cli dockerize --data ./sample-data.json --port 3000 --output ./tmp/Dockerfile`

- navigate to the `tmp` folder, where the Dockerfile has been generated and the environment file(s) copied:

  `cd tmp`

- Build the image:

  `docker build -t mockoon-image .`

- Run the container:

  `docker run -d -p <host_port>:3000 mockoon-image`

## Logs

Logs are located in `~/.mockoon-cli/logs/{mock-name}.log`. This file contains all the log entries (all levels) produced by the running mock server. Most of the errors occurring in Mockoon CLI (or the main application) are not critical and therefore considered as normal output. As an example, if the JSON body from an entering request is erroneous, Mockoon will log a JSON parsing error, but it won't block the normal execution of the application.

As the CLI is running in the foreground, logs are also sent to stdout (console).

### Transaction logging

When using the `--log-transaction` flag, logs will contain the full transaction (request and response) with the same information you can see in the desktop application "Logs" tab.

Example:

```json
{
  "app": "mockoon-server",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Transaction recorded",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ",
  "environmentName": "Demo API",
  "environmentUUID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "requestMethod": "GET",
  "requestPath": "/test",
  "requestProxied": false,
  "responseStatus": 200,
  "transaction": {
    "proxied": false,
    "request": {
      "body": "{}",
      "headers": [{ "key": "accept", "value": "*/*" }],
      "method": "GET",
      "params": [],
      "query": "",
      "queryParams": {},
      "route": "/test",
      "urlPath": "/test"
    },
    "response": {
      "body": "{}",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "content-type", "value": "application/json; charset=utf-8" }
      ],
      "statusCode": 200,
      "statusMessage": "OK"
    },
    "routeResponseUUID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "routeUUID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

The `transaction` model can be found [here](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/commons/src/models/server.model.ts#L33-L53).

### Disable logging

You can disable the logging to the console by redirecting the stdout and stderr outputs:

- Unix:

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```

  or:

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json &> /dev/null
  ```

- Windows (cmd):

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json 2> NUL
  ```

  or:

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json > NUL 2>&1
  ```

- Windows (PowerShell):

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json 2> $null
  ```

  or:

  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json > $null 2>&1
  ```

- Cross platform: use `dev-null-cli` package
  ```sh-sessions
  mockoon-cli start --data ./data.json | npx dev-null
  ```

You can also disable file logging by using th `--disable-log-to-file` flag. This is enabled by default in the Docker image.
