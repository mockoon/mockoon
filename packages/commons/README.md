Mockoon's Commons library regroups Mockoon's shared code used in the [desktop application](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/app) and the [CLI](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/cli). It contains mostly typings and is designed to be used in both the browser and Node.js environments.
