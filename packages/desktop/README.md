Mockoon is the easiest and quickest way to run mock APIs locally. No remote deployment, no account required, free and open-source.

It's a set of tools (desktop application and CLI) that help you work faster with APIs by mocking them: integrate third-party APIs quicker, improve your integration tests, speed up your development, etc.
